Frog Game
=========

This project is just me messing about with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).

However, it is a playable game.  Collect the trophies.  Meet Pink.  Find the
secrets!

Playable demo is available here: ed_am.itch.io/frog-game

Technical Notes
---------------

Game is only 2D.  Had fun creating some custom scenes (like the water) and
figured out how Godot does collision, UI, animations, particle emitters,
tiles and inheritance...
