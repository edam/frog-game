Frog Game
---------

This project is just me messing about with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).

However, it is a playable game.  Collect the trophies.  Meet Pink.  Find the
secrets!

👨‍💻 Technical Notes
---------------

Game is only 2D.  Had fun creating some custom scenes (like the water) and
figuring out how Godot does collision, UI, animations, particle emitters,
tiles and inheritance...

Next up, I want to add game load/save (already have game state) and move
game to an instanced scene (rather than main) so that it can be restarted.
